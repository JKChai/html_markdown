# README

Create a markdown like html with the help of CSS. The idea is to have a well designed and customizable html to document projects so that collaborators can view the html file with ease in a shared folder offline instead of having to use a proprietary app. 

A preview of the html can be view from this GitHub page: [https://jkchai.github.io/html_markdown/](https://jkchai.github.io/html_markdown/)

The CSS is adapted from this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/JamesMessinger/5d31c053d0b1d52389eb2723f7550907).
